A clone of a popular Indian Gameshow, Kaun Banega Crorepati (A clone itself of American Gameshow "Who wants to be a millionaire"). Using a Python backend (flask) + HTML/CSS frontend. A dynamic question/json file governs the questionare, with mode, options, correct option, and the actual question. The game has three modes: Recognize the celebrities (parts of faces of various celebrities is combined, and the player has to reconginize all of them), Guess the song + singer, then sing. Guess the song + movie (a mute MV is played). Finally, guess the movie from bas description. All the animaitons are done within HTML itself. All the JS is contained within the <script></script> tags, because why bother? Most of the time went in creating questions and changing things because the teachers wanted it changed. Had to re-write the entire thing a couple of times.
